## 1. Sliding Window Pattern

### Use:
The **Sliding Window Pattern** is an efficient way to handle problems that involve subarrays or substrings. It is useful when you need to find subarrays/substrings that meet specific conditions within an array or a string.

### Key Concept:
Rather than re-calculating results by iterating through subarrays repeatedly, the sliding window technique adjusts the window's boundaries dynamically, reducing time complexity.

### Examples:
Here are some common problems that can be solved using the Sliding Window Pattern:

1. **Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K**  
   Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum of a subarray of size `K`.

2. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**  
   Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

3. **Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters**  
   Given a string, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most `K` distinct characters.
